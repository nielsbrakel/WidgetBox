WidgetBox adds clean, native-looking widgets to your Homey dashboard. Designed to fit perfectly with Homey's style, these widgets help you customize your dashboard just the way you like it.

WidgetBox Utilities adds handy tools to your Homey dashboard that help with everyday tasks and dashboard organization.

The Stopwatch lets you time anything right from your dashboard. Run multiple stopwatches simultaneously. Enable lap timing to track splits, and toggle millisecond precision on or off depending on how much detail you need.

The Timer gives you countdown functionality with full multi-timer support. Configure the default duration for new timers and set how many can run at the same time. Whether you are timing a cooking recipe or keeping track of multiple tasks, the timer has you covered.



All utility widgets blend seamlessly with your dashboard and adapt to light and dark mode automatically.
