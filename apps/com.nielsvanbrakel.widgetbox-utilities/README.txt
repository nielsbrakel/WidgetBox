WidgetBox brings premium, beautifully designed widgets to your Homey dashboard. Every widget is crafted to feel right at home on Homey, respecting its design language and adapting seamlessly to light and dark mode. WidgetBox fills the gaps that the default dashboard leaves open, giving you more ways to personalize and enhance your smart home experience.

WidgetBox Utilities adds handy tools to your Homey dashboard that help with everyday tasks and dashboard organization.

The Stopwatch lets you time anything right from your dashboard. Run multiple stopwatches simultaneously with support for up to five at once. Enable lap timing to track splits, and toggle millisecond precision on or off depending on how much detail you need.

The Timer gives you countdown functionality with full multi-timer support. Configure the default duration for new timers and set how many can run at the same time. Whether you are timing a cooking recipe or keeping track of multiple tasks, the timer has you covered.

The Spacer is a simple but essential layout tool. Use it to add vertical breathing room between your other widgets. Adjust the height multiplier to get exactly the spacing you want, creating a clean and organized dashboard layout.

All utility widgets blend seamlessly with your dashboard and adapt to light and dark mode automatically.
