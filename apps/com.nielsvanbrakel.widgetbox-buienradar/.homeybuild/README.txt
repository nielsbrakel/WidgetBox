WidgetBox adds clean, native-looking widgets to your Homey dashboard. Designed to fit perfectly with Homey's style, these widgets help you customize your dashboard just the way you like it.

WidgetBox Buienradar puts Dutch precipitation data right on your Homey dashboard with useful widgets.

The Precipitation Forecast shows an hourly rain forecast as a graph. Choose between bar, line, or smooth line chart styles and pick your favorite chart color. Set your exact coordinates to get local predictions, and configure how often the data refreshes automatically.

The Location Zoom Map displays an animated precipitation radar centered on your location. Enter a city name or postal code and select a zoom level from country-wide down to your city or municipality. View the past hour of rainfall or the forecast for the coming three hours.

The Five-Day Radar gives you a broader overview with a five-day precipitation forecast sourced directly from Buienradar.

All widgets support configurable aspect ratios and adapt to both light and dark mode on your dashboard.
