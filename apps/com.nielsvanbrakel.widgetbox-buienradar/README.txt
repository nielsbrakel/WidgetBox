WidgetBox Buienradar puts Dutch precipitation data right on your Homey dashboard with three powerful widgets.

The Precipitation Forecast shows an hourly rain forecast as a graph. Choose between bar, line, or smooth line chart styles and pick your favorite chart color. Set your exact coordinates to get hyper-local predictions, and configure how often the data refreshes automatically.

The Location Zoom Map displays an animated precipitation radar centered on your location. Enter a city name or postal code and select a zoom level from country-wide down to your city or municipality. View the past hour of rainfall or the forecast for the coming three hours.

The Five-Day Radar gives you a broader overview with a five-day precipitation forecast sourced directly from Buienradar.

All widgets support configurable aspect ratios and adapt perfectly to both light and dark mode on your dashboard.
