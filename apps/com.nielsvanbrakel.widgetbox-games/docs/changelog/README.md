# Aquarium Spec Changelog

This folder tracks changes to `AQUARIUM_SPEC.md` between versions. Each file documents what changed, what was added, and what was removed.

When updating the spec, always:
1. Bump the **Spec version** in the spec header
2. Add a new changelog entry here
3. Keep the changelog in reverse chronological order (newest first)
