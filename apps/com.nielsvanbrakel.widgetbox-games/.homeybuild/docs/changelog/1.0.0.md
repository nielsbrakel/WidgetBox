# Spec v1.0.0 — 2026-02-19

Initial version of the Aquarium widget specification.

## Key Decisions

- **Three tank biomes** (Fresh, Tropical, Saltwater) with extensible architecture for future biomes
- **Server-authoritative** — all game logic in `api.js`, client is a dumb renderer
- **No permanent death** — fish enter Weak state instead
- **Per-tank economy** — coins, food stock, and cleanliness are independent per tank
- **Catalog-driven content** — all balance/content defined in a static catalog object with versioning and ID aliasing

## Content

### Fish
- **Fresh:** Guppy, Goldfish, Snail
- **Tropical:** Neon Tetra, Blue-Eye, Moon Fish, Discus, Pleco, Gourami
- **Saltwater:** Clownfish, Blue Tang, Green Chromis, Firefish, Royal Gramma, Banggai Cardinalfish, Moray Eel, Cleaner Shrimp

### Diet System
- Simple `accepts` array per fish — each fish has a list of foods it will eat, the rest is ignored
- Moray Eel accepts Live Shrimp (premium food)

### Tools
- **Tropical:** Heater (required), Filter
- **Saltwater:** Filter (required), Protein Skimmer (required), UV Sterilizer (required — **-20 happiness penalty** to all salt fish if not owned)

### Systems
- Deterministic cleaning with wipe-mask grid
- Food particles with sink physics and fish targeting
- Laser pointer play mode with 6h cooldown
- Plant growth and floating plant multiplication (deterministic spread)
- Happiness system with visible penalty breakdowns
- Migration framework with catalog reconciliation and ID aliasing

### Sections
27 sections covering: platform constraints, design principles, architecture, save model, catalog, tanks, fish, happiness, weak state, decor, plant growth, tool modes, cleaning, feeding, play mode, economy, progression, rendering, HUD, help, debug, backwards compatibility, game lifecycle, code maintenance, implementation backlog, and testing strategy.
