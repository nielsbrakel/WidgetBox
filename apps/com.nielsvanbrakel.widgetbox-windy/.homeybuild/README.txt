WidgetBox adds clean, native-looking widgets to your Homey dashboard. Designed to fit perfectly with Homey's style, these widgets help you customize your dashboard just the way you like it.

WidgetBox Windy embeds an interactive Windy.com weather map directly on your Homey dashboard.

View real-time weather data with your choice of overlay: wind patterns, temperature, rain, clouds, or atmospheric pressure. Set your coordinates to center the map on your location, and optionally show a location marker so you can always find your spot at a glance.

Choose between forecast models including ECMWF, GFS, and NAM. Configure the height level from surface to 100 meters for more detailed wind data. Switch between metric and imperial units for temperature, wind speed, and rainfall.

Enable the detail view for an in-depth weather breakdown at a specific location, with separately configurable coordinates if needed.

The widget supports multiple aspect ratios from panoramic to square, so it fits well into any dashboard arrangement.
