WidgetBox brings premium, beautifully designed widgets to your Homey dashboard. Every widget is crafted to feel right at home on Homey, respecting its design language and adapting seamlessly to light and dark mode. WidgetBox fills the gaps that the default dashboard leaves open, giving you more ways to personalize and enhance your smart home experience.

WidgetBox Windy embeds an interactive Windy.com weather map directly on your Homey dashboard.

View real-time weather data with your choice of overlay: wind patterns, temperature, rain, clouds, or atmospheric pressure. Set your coordinates to center the map on your location, and optionally show a location marker so you can always find your spot at a glance.

Choose between forecast models including ECMWF, GFS, and NAM. Configure the height level from surface to 100 meters for more detailed wind data. Switch between metric and imperial units for temperature, wind speed, and rainfall.

Enable the detail view for an in-depth weather breakdown at a specific location, with separately configurable coordinates if needed.

The widget supports multiple aspect ratios from panoramic to square, so it fits perfectly into any dashboard arrangement.
