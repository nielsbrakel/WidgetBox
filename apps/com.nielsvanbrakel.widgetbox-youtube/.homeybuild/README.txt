WidgetBox brings premium, beautifully designed widgets to your Homey dashboard. Every widget is crafted to feel right at home on Homey, respecting its design language and adapting seamlessly to light and dark mode. WidgetBox fills the gaps that the default dashboard leaves open, giving you more ways to personalize and enhance your smart home experience.

WidgetBox YouTube lets you watch YouTube videos, livestreams, and playlists directly on your Homey dashboard.

Enter a video ID or playlist ID to start watching. Enable autoplay to have the video start automatically when the dashboard loads, or keep controls visible so you can play and pause at your convenience.

Loop your favorite background video or ambient livestream for a continuous experience. Mute the audio if you just want the visuals. Set a start time in seconds to jump straight to the part that matters.

Choose from six aspect ratios including standard widescreen, square, portrait, ultrawide, and panoramic to make the video fit perfectly into your dashboard layout.
