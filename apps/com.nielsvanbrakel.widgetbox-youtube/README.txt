WidgetBox adds clean, native-looking widgets to your Homey dashboard. Designed to fit perfectly with Homey's style, these widgets help you customize your dashboard just the way you like it.

WidgetBox YouTube lets you watch YouTube videos, livestreams, and playlists directly on your Homey dashboard.

Enter a video ID or playlist ID to start watching. Enable autoplay to have the video start automatically when the dashboard loads, or keep controls visible so you can play and pause at your convenience.

Loop your favorite background video or ambient livestream for a continuous experience. Mute the audio if you just want the visuals. Set a start time in seconds to jump straight to the part that matters.

Choose from multiple aspect ratios including standard widescreen, square, portrait, ultrawide, and panoramic to make the video fit well into your dashboard layout.
